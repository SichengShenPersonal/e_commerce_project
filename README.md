# Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis journey, covering everything from data cleaning to visualization and analysis. It uses a real-world dataset from Kaggle featuring Amazon Indiaâ€™s clothing sales, with the aim of preparing the data for deep insights and actionable conclusions.

The project is structured into three key phases:

- **Python-Based Data Cleaning:**
In the initial phase, Python is used to perform basic cleaning operations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. The cleaned data is then converted into a CSV file that is compatible with SQL Server, making it ready for more advanced transformations.

- **SQL Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
The second phase involves using SQL for more comprehensive data cleaning and transformation. This process prepares the data for efficient analysis and visualization by ensuring it is well-structured and ready for exploration.

- **Popular Domestic Products Dashboard and Analysis:**
The final phase consists of building an interactive dashboard to analyze the most popular domestic products sold on Amazon India. By visualizing geographical and product category data, the dashboard provides deeper insights into customer preferences and sales trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
